        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: November 2025</p>

        <p>
            This Privacy Policy explains how this website collects, uses, and protects your information. 
            This site was created as part of a university web development project. It includes a 
            <strong>restaurant digital transformation case study</strong> and interactive features such 
            as a cookie consent system.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>This website does not collect personal data such as names, emails, or contact details.</p>
        <p>However, we may collect non-personal information such as:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Basic analytics (e.g., page visits, browser type)</li>
            <li>Device or usage data</li>
            <li>Cookie preferences stored in your browser</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
        <p>
            This website uses cookies to improve the experience and allow certain features to function properly. 
            Cookies are small files stored on your device.
        </p>

        <p>We use two types of cookies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Essential cookies</strong> – needed for the site to work (e.g., saving cookie preferences).</li>
            <li><strong>Performance cookies</strong> – optional cookies that help us understand how the site is used.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Your Cookie Choices</h2>
        <p>
            When you visit the site, a cookie banner appears. You can choose:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accept All Cookies</strong> – allows all cookie types.</li>
            <li><strong>Manage Preferences</strong> – allows selective control.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Your choice is saved locally in your browser and can be cleared at any time by removing the 
        <code>cookieChoice</code> value in your localStorage.</p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Content</h2>
        <p>
            The restaurant case study may include third-party integrations such as embedded maps 
            or links to external websites. These external sites have their own privacy policies and are not controlled by us.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Restaurant Case Study (Digital Transformation)</h2>
        <p>
            The “Restaurant Digital Transformation” page demonstrates how a traditional restaurant might use 
            simple website features to improve online visibility — such as menus, booking information, opening hours, 
            social media links, and contact forms.
        </p>

        <p>This is <strong>fictional and for educational purposes only</strong>. No real business data is collected.</p>

        <h2>6. How We Protect Your Data</h2>
        <p>
            No personal data is collected or processed by this website. All cookie choices are stored only on your device.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Contact</h2>
        <p>
            If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or this project, you can contact me through 
            my university email.
